Example matlab scripts for plotting from gmt netcdf output.
Scripts use stuff from utils/matlab/gmt and utils/matlab in
the MITgcm CVS tree - so that needs to be in your search path
e.g. addpath ${mitgcm_rootdir}/utils/matlab/gmt.
Many of the functions work with the structure from rdnctiles, so
that is used in the example to load the data.

Example driver is plot_llc.m. Running that calls the other scripts

calcFacetAngles.m  :: Calculate rotation angles to project to 
                   :: XG, YG coordinate system.

croptiled.m        :: Crop data to remove values for fields 
                   :: read in by rdnctiles

llc_pcol.m         :: Do a colormap of something read in by
                   :: rdnctiles

llc_vec.m          :: Do a vector plot of something read in
                   :: by rdnctiles

plot_compact_mdsio.m
                   :: Read global or tiled mdsio lat-lon-cap output and 
                   :: do simple global plot (Arctic duplicated 4 times)

plot_llc.m         :: Example driver for plotting 72 tile lat-lon cap
                   :: output. This is mostly general except
                   :: for directory locations and the removal of tiles
                   :: 69-72 which are junk for this specific configuration.
                   :: Example script produces both color scale and vector
                   :: plots.
                   :: It requires mnc generated grid files and 
                   :: mnc generated time average files. 
                   :: Example grid files can be found at
                   :: wget http://mitgcm.org/mitgcm_repo/MITgcm_contrib/cnh_cs_plot/plot_llc_datasets/llc_grid_72tiles/v20070507/'grid.t001.nc'
                   :: Example mnc time average files can be found at
                   :: wget http://mitgcm.org/mitgcm_repo/MITgcm_contrib/cnh_cs_plot/plot_llc_datasets/llc_48month/v20070507/'tave.0000000001.t001.nc'

quikpcolor         :: faster replacement for pcolor using image
                   :: when used with homogeneous grid spacing, it is also more
                   :: accurate as it plots one facet per grid cell, as opposed
                   :: to interpolating between cell corners as does pcolor

quikplot           :: quick and dirty llc plotting routine
                   :: usage example for llc270 domain:
                   :: fld=quikread_llc('Depth.data',270);
                   :: quikplot_llc(fld)

quikread           :: quick and dirty llc read routine

vel2latlon.m       :: Rotate vectors according pre-calculated angles
                   :: ( from calcFacetAngles ).

zmean.m            :: Calculate a vertical integral divided by depth
                   :: for a field and depths read in by rdnctiles.
