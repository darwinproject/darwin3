   =======   gmt:  General MITgcm Tiles/Topologies   =======

This directory contains MatLAB and shell utilities for post-processing
data on generalized MITgcm tiles and topologies.  It is meant to work
with the input and output from the latest version of the "mnc" package
(the MITgcm netCDF interface) for all kinds of MITgcm domains
including:

 - "traditional" exch1 topologies
 - exch2 cubes
 - more general topologies

and the available tools are:

  rdnctiles.m  ::  reads data from collections of netCDF tiles
