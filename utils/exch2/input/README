Examples of parameter file "data.exch2" can be found here;
Some dimension files "SIZE.h" which match the "data.exch2"
files are also provided.

naming convention: 
 llc_120 : lat-lon-cap grid, 120-360-120 (=nRed,nGreen,nBlue)
 (grid-files in MITgcm_contrib/llc_120/grid_files )

SIZE.h.14t_120x120 :
   llc_120 grid, 6-facets, tiles size = 120x120, no blank tiles
      (<=> largest tile size => minimum total Nb of tiles = 14)

SIZE.h.156t_20x60 : can be used with:
      llc_120, 6-facets, tiles =  20x60 + 12 blank tiles
   or llc_120, 5-facets, tiles =  20x60 , no blank tiles
   or cs-180,  6-facets, tiles =  20x60 +  6 blank tiles

data.exch2.llc_120_6f :
 llc_120, 6-facets, no blank tiles 
 works for any tiling of facets and in particular with SIZE.h.14t_120x120

data.exch2.llc_120_6f.168t-12b :
 llc_120, 6-facets, 168 tiles - 12 blank tiles = 156 active tiles
 Notes: list and number of blank-tiles generaly depend on tiling of facets;
        however, to blank out the last facet just requires listing all tiles
        of the last facets and does not depend on precise tile-size but
        just on Number of tiles.
 works with SIZE.h.156t_20x60 (and also SIZE.h.156t_60x20 <- not provided)

data.exch2.llc_120_5f :
 llc_120, 5-facets (drop the last one), no blank tiles
 works for any facet tiling, and in particular with SIZE.h.156t_20x60

data.exch2.cs180.162t-6b_20x60 :
 regular CS-180 cube, 162 tiles - 6 blank (on face 2 along the Eq) = 156 active T.
 would work with SIZE.h.156t_20x60 (but what about grid-files ?)
