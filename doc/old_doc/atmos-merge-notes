Notes for the merging of AJA's and JMC's atmospheric codes into
main-stream code:

branch-atmos-merge		Created branch
branch-atmos-merge-start	Initial state (equiv. to checkpoint33)
branch-atmos-merge-phase1	Phase 1: moved correction step from
                                top of dynamics() to end of the_main_loop()
branch-atmos-merge-phase2	Phase 2: re-arranged calling order in
                                dynamics() in order to facilitate staggered
                                time-stepping at a later date
branch-atmos-merge-phase3       Phase 3: sorted out OBCs in new dynamics(),
                                tested in exp4, sorted out gmredi, tested
                                in front_relax
branch-atmos-merge-phase4       Phase 4: re-wrote calc_phi_hyd(),
                                find_rho() and deleted calc_buoyancy()
branch-atmos-merge-phase5       Phase 5: added and tested staggered time-step
branch-atmos-merge-phase6       Phase 6: tested staggered time-step with CD scheme
branch-atmos-merge-phase7       Phase 7: new parameter for initializing
                                vertical grid (needed by atmos), newer
                                ini_masks_etc.F (new hFacC calc. for atmos),
                                ini_spherical_grid.F (deals with pole better)
branch-atmos-merge-shapiro      Shapiro code packaged.
branch-atmos-merge-zonalfilt    Zonal filters packaged and test in
                                verification/hs94.128x64x5
branch-atmos-merge-freeze	Freeze prior to merge with main
