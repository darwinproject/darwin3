P. Heimbach, MIT/EAPS, 24-Mar-2001
----------------------------------
All changed files are (hopefully) listed below.

added:
-----
- pkg/autodiff/
- pkg/cost/
- pkg/ctrl/
- adjoint/
- verification/vero/

eesupp/src/ & pkg/mdsio/ OK
------------------------
- mdsio.F, mdsio_gl.F:
    global routines required for global read/write
    in ecco replaced by routines that don't use
    dynamic memory allocation.

- mdsio_slice.F: added to both dir's
    handle sliced (x-z, y-z) I/O, needed for OBCS.

model/inc/ OK
---------
- PARAMS.h: added dQdTFile

- FFIELDS.h: added dQdT

adjoint/
-------
- makefile: OK
  updated to incorporate new routines and skipped old

model/src/
---------
- the_model_main.F: OK

- the main_sens.F: OK
  should replace the_main_loop.F, forward_step.F !!!
  changed various storings of model state

- ini_parms.F: OK
  added dQdTFile

- set_defaults.F: OK
  added dQdTFile

- packages_init_variables.F: OK
  * call ctrl_map_init
  * call cost_init
  * call ecco_init
  * handling of ini_forcing

- packages_readparms.F: OK
  * call cost_readparms
  * call ctrl_init
  * call ecco_readparms

- solve_for_pressure.F: OK
  TAMC didn't like write(0,...

- initialise_varia.F, convective_adjustment.F: OK
  big problem with calling convective_adjustment
  already here, i.e. before dynamics,
  because storage keys are not yet available.
  Is this really necessary?
  -> call convective_adjustment only for ifndef ALLOW_AUTODIFF_TAMC
  -> keys are recomputed inside convective_adjustment.F

- the_correction_step:
  -> keys are recomputed for the case useOBCS

- ini_fields.F, ini_wvel.F: OK
  added call to new S/R ini_wvel to initialise wVel

- dynamics.F: looks OK
  started to work on modified key comp. and store directives

- moved some key declarations to tamc.h
  * tamc.h
  * kpp_calc.F

store directives are up to now in
---------------------------------
- (convective_adjustment -> has to be removed from there)
- calc_phi_hyd
- dynamics
- the_correction_step
- the_main_sens
- kpp_calc
- kpp_routines

Further changes:
###############

- added pkg/autodiff/timeave.flow

- forward_step no longer exist.
  Is inlined into the_main_loop
