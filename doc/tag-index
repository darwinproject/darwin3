    Notes on tags used in darwin
    ============================

ctrb_darwin_ckpt61d_20081013
o upgrade to checkpoint61d of MITgcm
o DAR_cons_unit[1-4] get separate common block

ctrb_darwin_ckpt61b_20080822
o upgrade to checkpoint61b of MITgcm

ctrb_darwin_ckpt61_20080822
o add code to relax nutrients (needed for 1-D version)
o add waveband dependence of light attenuation and absorption,
  - NOTE: need to have geider turned on too
o add geider chl:c ratio and growth rate dependence,
  - no photo-inhibition at this point
o make number of phytoplankton species flexible (at compile time)
  - DARWIN_SIZE defines location of darwin fields in Ptracer

ctrb_darwin_ckpt61_20080624
o upgrade to checkpoint61 of MITgcm

ctrb_darwin_ckpt60_20080619
o upgrade to checkpoint60 of MITgcm

ctrb_darwin_ckpt59r_20080606
o upgrade to checkpoint59r of MITgcm

ctrb_darwin_ckpt59q_20080605
o upgrade to checkpoint59q of MITgcm
  - verification/darwin_baltic_76x72x24: fix topography for obcs

ctrb_darwin_ckpt59p_20080604
o upgrade to checkpoint59p of MITgcm
  - introduces data.darwin; the following parameters have been moved
    from data.gchem to data.darwin:
      iceFile -> darwin_iceFile
      IronFile -> darwin_ironFile
      Filename1 -> darwin_PARFile
      Filename2 -> darwin_nutWVelFile
      gchem_int1 -> darwin_seed
      gchem_ForcingPeriod -> darwinForcingPeriod
      gchem_ForcingCycle -> gchem_ForcingCycle

ctrb_darwin_ckpt59o_20080602
o upgrade to checkpoint59o of MITgcm

ctrb_darwin_ckpt59n_20080424
o verification/darwin_baltic_76x72x24: change from OLDSEED to PORT_RAND
o upgrade to checkpoint59n of MITgcm
  - introduces PTRACERS_PARAMS.h and PTRACERS_FIELDS.h
  - changes in obcs and seaice
  - pickupStriclyMatch

ctrb_darwin_ckpt59i_20080226
o load forcing fields if gchem_ForcingPeriod.NE.0 (instead of periodicExternalForcing)

cp59i_noironwithexf
o add darwin global verification experiment
o change default phymin to 1e-20
o change floating point constants to _d
o portable random number generator

cp59i
o initial checkin.  Works with MITgcm checkpoint59i
