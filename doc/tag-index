o change default inhibcoef_geid_val back to zero

ctrb_darwin_ckpt61f_20100522
o add aCDOM diagnostic: #define DAR_DIAG_ACDOM (available with WAVEBANDS)
  parameters in data.darwin:
  - darwin_diag_acdom_ilam :: waveband index (or wavelength) to diagnose
o add option to compute aCDOM from Chlorophyll: #define DAR_CALC_ACDOM
  parameters in data.darwin:
  - darwin_Sdom :: spectral slope for wavelength dependence of aCDOM
o fix reading of OASIM data (#define OASIM) regardless WAVEBANDS;
  parameters in data.darwin:
  - darwin_oasim_edFile, darwin_oasim_esFile :: file names
  - darwin_oasim_waves :: band center wavelengths in nm
                          (when used without WAVEBANDS)
