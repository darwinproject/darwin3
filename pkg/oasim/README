OASIM package
=============

The following variables are automatically computed and can be used by
including OASIM_SIZE.h and OASIM_FIELDS.h:

  OASIM_lam     :: wavelengths of wavebands (nm)
  OASIM_solz    :: above-water solar zenith angle (degrees)
  OASIM_rmud    :: inverse cosine of below-water solar zenith angle
  OASIM_Edabove :: downwelling beam irradiance above sea surface
  OASIM_Esabove :: downwelling diffuse irradiance above sea surface
  OASIM_Edbelow :: downwelling beam irradiance below sea surface
  OASIM_Esbelow :: downwelling diffuse irradiance below sea surface

This package is based on the OASIM software available here:
