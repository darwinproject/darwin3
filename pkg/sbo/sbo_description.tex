Pacakge sbo implements diagnostic code to compute IERS Special
Bureau for the Oceans (SBO) core products, including oceanic mass,
center-of-mass, and angular momentum.

Includes time variable mass from freshwater flux, which affects OAMP
and COM.  To remove freshwater flux impacts from OAMP, simply remove
the provided freshwater component: OAMP_nofw = OAMP - OAMP_fw.  To
remove freshwater flux impacts from COM, you need to scale by mass:
COM_nofw = (COM*mass - COM_fw*mass_fw)/(mass - mass_fw).
