Package ``seaice'' provides a dynamic and thermodynamic interactive sea-ice
model.  Sea-ice model thermodynamics are based on Hibler (see Modeling a Variable Thickness Sea-Ice Cover, Hibler, Monthly Weather Review, 1980), 
that is, a 2-category model that simulates ice thickness and concentration.  
Snow is simulated as per Zhang et al. (see Arctic ice-ocean modeling with
and without climate restoring, Zhang et. al, Journal of Physical Oceanography,
1998).  
Sea-ice dynamics is based
on a viscous-plastic model solved using the alternating-direction-implicit (ADI) method of
Zhang and Rothrock (see Modeling Arctic Sea Ice with an Efficient Plastic 
Solution, Zhang and Rothrock, Journal of Geophysical Research, 2000).
