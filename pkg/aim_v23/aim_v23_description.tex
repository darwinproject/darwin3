Package aim\_v23 contains code for an intermediate complexity atmospheric 
physics scheme derived from the physics in the SPEEDY model of Franco Molteni. 
The package contains the SPEEDY physics routines, re-cast to work with pressure
coordinate dynamics, together with code that interfaces the SPEEDY
internal arrays to the MITgcm dynamical kernel.
