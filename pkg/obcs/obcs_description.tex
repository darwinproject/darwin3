Package obcs contains code for use in open-boundary simulations.
The obcs package is user configurable and supports
Orlanski style radiative boundary flow dynamics and prescribed
inflow/outflow and tracer distribution boundary conditions. Options for
sponge layers of user defined thicknesses are provided as well as options to 
select net inflows and outflows of properties be kept in
balance.
