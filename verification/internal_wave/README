Example: "Internal Wave Forced by Open Boundary"
================================================

This uses a simply EOS (rho = - rho_o alpha T')
 and treats salt as a passive tracer.

Configure and compile the code:
  cd build
  ../../../tools/genmake2 -mods ../code [-of my_platform_optionFile]
  make depend
  make
  cd ..

To run:
  cd run
  ln -s ../input/* .
  ln -s ../build/mitgcmuv .
  ./mitgcmuv > output.txt
  cd ..

There is comparison output in:
  results/output.txt

Comments:
  The input data is real*8 and generated using the MATLAB script
  input/gendata.m
