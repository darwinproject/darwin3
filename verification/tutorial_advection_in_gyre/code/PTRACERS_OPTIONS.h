C NUMBER_OF_PTRACERS defines how many passive tracers are allocated/exist.
C This CPP macro is *only* used in PTRACERS.h to set an integer parameter.
C <Please> do not make use of it elsewhere.
C   Note: this CPP macro has been removed to avoid confusion and risk of
C    error resulting from multiple definitions (default + explicit) within
C    the code.
C    The maximum number of tracers is now defined within PTRACERS_SIZE.h
C---

C     This enables the dynamically allocated internal state data structures
C     for PTracers.  Needed for PTRACERS_SOM_Advection.
C     This requires a Fortran 90 compiler!
