Five level intermediate atmospheric physics example.
 Experimental configuration is an equatorial channel
 of 65 degrees wide cented on the Equator. A warm SST anomaly
 with a gaussian shape is defined at the center of the domain
 with an extension of ~30 degrees meridionally and ~60 degrees
 zonally.

The local copy of S/R aim_surf_bc.F (in code directory) provide
a) the SST field (hard coded).
b) the time in the year is fixed and corresponds to the spring equinox;
 this ensures a symetric forcing between N & S hemispheres.
The model uses the standard 5-level vertical resolution of the Speedy_v23
 code; the horizontal resolution is 2.8125 with 128x23 grid points.

====================================================================

Configure and compile the code:
  cd build
  ../../../tools/genmake2 -mods ../code [-of my_platform_optionFile]
  make depend
  make
  cd ..

To run:
  cd run
  ln -s ../input/* .
  ln -s ../build/mitgcmuv .
  ./mitgcmuv > output.txt
  cd ..

There is comparison output in the directory:
  results/output.txt

---------------------------
Notes:
* To produce a short test that is relevant for the Atmosphere physics part,
  a restart file (pickup.0000051840) is included. The model reaches
  a statistical equilibrium after 1 year.
* the file aim_SST.* contains the SST field.
* Since aim pkg uses arrays with MAX_NO_THREADS as dimension, the maximum
  number of treads is set to 1 (in code/EEPARAMS.h) instead of 32, so that the
  size of the executable is reduced. This obviously needs to be changed
  before compiling on a multi-threaded platform.
---------------------------
Northern boundary :
o initially, the domain (SIZE.h) 128x24x5 with a land line as the Northern
  boundary, reduciong the effective domain to 128x23x5.
o To have a more efficient code (and a good starting point for MIT Atmos.
  Physics), the new domain (SIZE.h) is now 128x23x5 .
  Northern and Southern boundaries are "closed" like the in Lat-Lon set-up.
