Seaice-only verification experiment in idealized periodic channel with
ice thickness distribution (otherwise very similar to
offline_exf_seaice): CPP-flag SEAICE_ITD is defined
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1) main forward experiment (code, input)

  Re-entrant zonally periodic channel (80x42 grid points) with just level (Nr=1)
   uniform resolution (5.km, 10m), solid Southern boundary with triangular shape
   coastline ("bathy_3c.bin")

  Use seaice (dynamics & thermodynamics from pkg/seaice) with EXF (see data.pkg)
   with initial ice thickness ranging from nearly 0 m in the "south"
   to over 7 m in the "north"(but no snow)
   (HeffFile  = 'heff_quartic.bin', in "input/data.seaice")
  Initial seaice concentration is 100 % everywhere
   (AreaFile='const100.bin', in "input/data.seaice")
  and seaice is initially at rest.

  Ridging is computed according to Thorndyke et al (1975) and Hibler
  (1980). Ice strength P is computed following Rothrock (1975)

  At runtime turn off time-stepping in 'data', PARM01, using:
    momStepping  = .FALSE.,
    saltStepping = .FALSE.,
    tempAdvection=.FALSE.,

 Forcing:
  None of the forcing vary with time; the input files have been
   generated using the python script "input/gendata.py".
  SST relaxation field is uniform in X, parabolic function of Y with
   maximum close to Southern boundary.

  Atmospheric air temp is uniform in Y, and only vary with X (~sin(2.pi.x/Lx))
   with an amplitude of 4.K ('tair_4x.bin');
  Uses constant Relative Humidity (70%, file 'qa70_4x.bin')
  constant and uniform downward shortwave (100.W/m2, 'dsw_100.bin'),
                       downward longwave (250.W/m^2, 'dlw_250.bin'),
                       zonal wind (10.m/s, 'windx.bin'),
  no meridional wind, no precip.

  Ocean surface currents comes from a 3 levels ocean-only run (without seaice)
   using the same wind forcing (uVel_3c0.bin, vVel_3c0.bin) (matlab script:
  "input/getdata.m")

2) other (secondary) experiments (with the same executable)

 a) input.lipscomb07: seaice-dynamics only with ridging scheme
    following Lipscomb et al (2007); uses same forcing as main forward 
    experiment, without thermodynamic forcing
    (usePW79thermodynamics=.FALSE., SEAICEpartFunc = 1, SEAICEredistFunc = 1,
    in input.dyn_lsr/data.seaice).

 b) input.thermo: seaice-dynamics and thermodynamics with ridging, but
    ice strength is computed following Hibler (1979): 
    P = 27.5e4*(h*c)*exp(-20*(1-c))
