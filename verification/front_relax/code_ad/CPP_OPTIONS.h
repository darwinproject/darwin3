C
C CPP flags controlling which code in included in the files that
C will be compiled.

#ifndef CPP_OPTIONS_H
#define CPP_OPTIONS_H

#include "PACKAGES_CONFIG.h"

C o Shortwave heating as extra term in external_forcing.F
#ifdef ALLOW_KPP
#define  SHORTWAVE_HEATING
#endif

C o Include/exclude phi_hyd calculation code
#define INCLUDE_PHIHYD_CALCULATION_CODE

C o Include/exclude call to S/R CONVECT
#define INCLUDE_CONVECT_CALL

C o Include/exclude call to S/R CALC_DIFFUSIVITY
#define INCLUDE_CALC_DIFFUSIVITY_CALL

C o Allow full 3D specification of vertical diffusivity
#define ALLOW_3D_DIFFKR

C o Allow nonHydrostatic code
#undef  ALLOW_NONHYDROSTATIC

C o Use "Exact Convervation" of fluid in Free-Surface formulation
C   so that d/dt(eta) is exactly equal to - Div.Transport
#define EXACT_CONSERV

C o Allow the use of Non-Linear Free-Surface formulation
C   this implies that surface thickness (hFactors) vary with time
#undef NONLIN_FRSURF

C o Execution environment support options
#include "CPP_EEOPTIONS.h"

C o Add passive tracer advection routines
#define ALLOW_PASSIVE_TRACER

C o Include/exclude single header file containing multiple packages options
C   (AUTODIFF, COST, CTRL, ECCO, EXF ...) instead of the standard way where
C   each of the above pkg get its own options from its specific option file.
C   Although this method, inherited from ECCO setup, has been traditionally
C   used for all adjoint built, work is in progress to allow to use the
C   standard method also for adjoint built.
