Southern-Ocean box with Biochemistry, using Open-Boundary Conditions
 (pkg/obcs) at Northern, Eastern and Western edges of the domain.
======================================================================

This experiment illustrates and tests the use of package DIC with OBCS.

The configuration (e.g., resolution), model parameters and forcing are
almost identical to tutorial_global_oce_biogeo expect that the horizontal
domain is limited to a sub-domain around Drake passage with open-boundary
conditions coming from the last year of a 2 yrs global simulation and
initial conditions taken from t=1.yr of this same simulation.
This enable to compare directly the results of the first year simulation
of this regional set-up with the 2nd year results of the global set-up run.

Configure and compile the code:
  cd build
  ../../../tools/genmake2 -mods ../code [-of my_platform_optionFile]
  make depend
  make
  cd ..

To run:
  cd run
  ln -s ../input/* .
  ln -s ../build/mitgcmuv .
  ./mitgcmuv > output.txt
  cd ..

There is comparison output in the directory:
  results/output.txt

----------------------------------------------------------------------
To generate inital and open boundary conditions:
a) The global set-up (using executable from: tutorial_global_oce_biogeo/build)
   was run for 2 years using model-parameter from inp_global/.
 The only differences with the ones used in tutorial_global_oce_biogeo are:
 - CD-Scheme is turned off (useCDscheme=F), since it is not implemented for OBCS ;
 - as a consequence, horizontal viscosity (viscAh) is increased from 2.E5 to 3.E5;
 - convective-adjustment diffusivity (ivdc_kappa) is reduced from 100. to 10.m^2/s;
 - implicit vertical viscosity is turned off (not needed);
 - free-surface exact conservation is turned on (exactConserv=T);
 - use the Avective-Form of GM (in data.gmredi: GM_AdvForm=T) instead of Skew-Flux;

 to repeat this global simutlation, from so_box_biogeo/
  mkdir run_glob ; cd run_glob
  ln -s ../inp_global/* .
  ../inp_global/prepare_run
  ln -s ../../tutorial_global_oce_biogeo/build/mitgcmuv .
  ./mitgcmuv > output.glob
  cd ..

b) Then regional model forcing files, initial conditions and open-boundary
  conditions files are generated using the matlab script: "mk_box_input.m"
  cd inp_global/
  matlab
  >> mk_box_input
