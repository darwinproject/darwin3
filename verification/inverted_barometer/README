Example: "4 Layer Double Gyre with Pressure Loading"
====================================================

Comments:
The input data is real*8 and can be generated with the supplied
matlab script gendata.m
To change the input precision to real*4 change readBinaryPrec=32 in
data as well as in gendata.m

The experiment follow roughly the analytical analysis
