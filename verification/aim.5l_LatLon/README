Intermediate Atmospheric physics, 5 layers Molteni Physics package.
Global spherical-grid configuration, 128x64x5 resolution.
====================================================================

Configure and compile the code:
  cd build
  ../../../tools/genmake2 -mods ../code [-of my_platform_optionFile]
  make depend
  make
  cd ..

To run:
  cd run
  ln -s ../input/* .
  ln -s ../build/mitgcmuv .
  ./mitgcmuv > output.txt
  cd ..

There is comparison output in the directory:
  results/output.txt

---------------------------
Note:
Originally, this set up was very close to the one in
/development/adcroft/atmos/verification/molteni.128x64x5
with few modifications taken from run on hyades.

Others modifications have been added to improve the stability of the
model (fixed some bugs) and to get a less diffuse Q distribution:
o 3rd order scheme for the Horizontal advection of Q
o changes in the mapping between C-grid and A-grid  for surface stress
