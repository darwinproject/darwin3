###############################################################
(Patrick Heimbach 00/06/08)

- split into single subroutines
- according to package structure, 
  call those optim_... (or ctrl_...?)
- harmonise all routines with data.ctrl 
  (especially file names that are specified in data.ctrl)
- create CPP options file for various flags
- get rid of read block in numbmod
- make sure unit no.'s are ok
- make sure all necesarry files are read/written
  (may have to extend ctrl_pack/ctrl_unpack)
